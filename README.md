## IRMA IoT Refrigerator Management Assistant
IRMA, “IoT Refrigerator Management Assistant”, provides a conduit that optimizes and adds tremendous value to the flow of food products to consumers.  In the United States, consumers annually purchase $765 billion of food products ($2 trillion worldwide) and store much of it in their refrigerators.  Food, grocery and marketing companies crave information on consumers’ refrigerator contents. Walmart, Amazon, PepsiCo, Tyson, and grocery chains all desire to know more about product usage and to gain better access to their customers. These capabilities enable better product marketing, packaging, and delivery.  Imagine that as products are used, their replacements are delivered automatically through a more efficient supply chain.  Or, personalized services and information that are delivered to each customer based on their consumption preferences.
